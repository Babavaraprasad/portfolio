    description:
      "An empirical research conducted in collaboration with Center for IT and Medical Technology (CIMT), Region Hovedstaden at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen to explore the challenges faced by first-time or non-regular visitors using the current navigation systems.Following the blaikies approach, we defined the research questions to validate the research aim followed by reviewing the relevant literature papers selected from Google Scholar as a source.To collect the data from our selected target group, we chose Qualitative approach. Firstly, we created Vignettes with different manipulated variables to create a realistic situations/user scenarios for the selected target users to perform at the hospital site. Secondly, We used observations and semi-structured interviews as our qualitative technique to understand the pain points of the users about the current navigation systems such as Hospital Map, Information Board about the department Information. Analysis of collected data is done using Affinity diagram, Diagnostic map, and Virtual map. Then to enhance the navigation experience and solve the pain points we designed a high fidelity prototype for the user interface following system design principles and had applied Jakob nielsens heuristic principles to ensure the usability of our application.",
